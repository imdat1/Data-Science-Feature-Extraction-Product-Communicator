PROMPT ZA COPILOT: 
I'm creating databases like this:"c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gaming_laptops (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    url TEXT,
                    title TEXT,
                    warranty INTEGER,
                    regular_price REAL,
                    happy_price REAL,
                    category TEXT
                 )''')

    # Create feature_products table
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS feature_gaming_laptops (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    feature_name TEXT,
                    feature_value TEXT
                 )''')

    # Create product_feature table
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gaming_laptop_feature (
                    product_id INTEGER,
                    feature_id INTEGER,
                    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES gaming_laptops(id),
                    FOREIGN KEY (feature_id) REFERENCES feature_gaming_laptops(id)
                 )''')" 
Can you give me a prompt which i can give to an AI that will understand what's going on with the tables?
